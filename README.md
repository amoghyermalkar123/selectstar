## SelectStar
SelectStar is a minimalistic personal query management app which helps you -
  * Add a query
  * Delete a query
  * View All Queries
  * View particular query
  * Search Queries by name (exact/ appropriate keyword match)

SelectStar is not a redash replacement. 
It is meant to be your personal tool to manage your plethora of queries (draft/ otherwise) that you want to dump in one place and retrieve anytime you want very quickly and easily.
